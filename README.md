# Overlook

## About The Project
* Overlook is a site for navigating a fictional hotel's webpage. A user can log in as a manager or one of 50 pre made customers. The manager can see the hotel's stats for the data along with any bookings for the day. A manager can search for a customer and either book them a room or delete a booking. The customer can see their total expenses and upcoming bookings. They can search for rooms by date and room type before booking a room. All booking information is posted, retrieved or deleted from a server.
* Overlook is the final project of 2nd module (12 weeks into program) of Turing School of Software Engineering. It is the first project to require fetching, spies testing, object inheritance and WebPack.
* This Project Uses:
  * HTML
  * Javascripts
  * CSS/SCSS
  * Chai/Mocha Testing
  * WebPack
